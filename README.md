## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an AI Research Scientist with a passion for applied mathematics, artificial intelligence, and exploring the broader tech landscape. Here, you'll find a collection of my projects, notes, and contributions to the open-source community.

### About Me

**Short Bio**

I am an AI Research Scientist working at the intersection of academic research and industry. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at CREST, supervised by Arnak Dalalyan, where my research focuses on generative modeling, with particular interest in diffusion models and flow matching. This work builds on a PhD in statistics and over six years of experience in data science and artificial intelligence.

My career spans both applied research and real-world deployment. I began at Thales, working on time series analysis, signal processing, object detection, and anomaly detection. I later joined Iktos, where I designed deep learning models for drug discovery, before contributing to foundational biological models at MBZUAI and GenBio AI.

In parallel with research, I maintain strong ties to industry and entrepreneurship. In 2025, I explored venture creation by developing proofs of concept for AI-driven decision-making tools, while freelancing on projects ranging from LLM observability platforms (Rollstack) to improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems (Clarifeye). I am driven by the challenge of translating cutting-edge theory into impactful, scalable AI systems.
